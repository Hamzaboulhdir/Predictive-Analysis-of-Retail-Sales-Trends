# üìä Sales Forecasting Analysis for Istanbul Retail Sector

## üìò Project Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model for forecasting shopping trends in the Istanbul retail sector. By leveraging a blend of data analysis techniques and machine learning models, it seeks to provide actionable insights that businesses can use for strategic decision-making.

## üéØ Objectives
- Analyze shopping data from Istanbul malls from 2021 to 2023.
- Enhance the analysis by integrating datasets on demographics, economic indicators, tourism statistics, and online search trends.
- Develop a predictive model for accurately forecasting sales trends.
- Showcase a comprehensive range of data analysis skills, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), advanced machine learning, and data visualization.
